What is this?
=============

Suppose you have a Windows machine running an SSH server using msys2.

You are interested in using powershell through it... but you quickly
realize the UI is shit as the powershell exposed that way doesn't have
history, the usual readline/inputrc bindings do nothing or insert
garbage.

Here comes sshps.

Run it with the usual option you would pass to ssh when trying to
access your Windows server.

* sshps will connect to the Windows host and run powershell on its own.
* It reads input using readline with all its good stuff (for now line editing and history)
* It sends and runs the command over to the remote powershell session
* Parses and cleans the output (large output are run through a pager)

No completion yet. Iin that environement <tab> doesn't do anything
anyway so you're not losing anything by using sshps.

Usage
=====

    sshps [ssh opts]


Installation
============

You need python3 and the pexpect package (it's a pure-python
package). It can be installed with:

    # pip3 install pexpect

You can then just copy sshps somewhere in your $PATH

Enjoy!
